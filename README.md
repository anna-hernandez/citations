This project contains two scripts.

retrieve_pubmed.py contains two functions that collect data on PubMed articles based either on a list of user-specified PMIDs - getPubmedSummary() - or a dates range - getPubmedsByDate(). The data is collected sending requests to the PubMed database using the NCBI e-utils.
